# iTunesPauser: simple tool for starting or pausing iTunes for Windows

## What is iTunesPauser?

iTunesPauser is a simple application that when run will pause or resume iTunes. If iTunes isn't currently running, it will launch it. That's all.

The latest Microsoft IntelliType Pro keyboard drivers -- which infuriatingly don't support the Microsoft Office Keyboard fully -- have a media "Play / Pause" option which only seems to work with Windows Media Player. By altering the command to execute iTunesPauser, you can use the button to control iTunes.

## Where can I get it?

 * [iTunesPauser 1.0](https://github.com/afit/iTunesPauser/raw/master/iTunesPauser.exe) (18th January 2006)

You'll need the [Microsoft .NET Framework Version 2.0](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&displaylang=en) installed.

## How do I make it work?

Unzip the downloaded file and put the two extracted files together somewhere. Run `iTunesPauser.exe`.
